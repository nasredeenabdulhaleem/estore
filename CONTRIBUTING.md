# Contributing to E-Commerce

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make Project Name such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](https://github.com/nasredeenabdulhaleem/estore/issues) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [make one](https://github.com/nasredeenabdulhaleem/estore/issues/new)!

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork the repository and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b feature/325-add-japanese-localization
